# Write a program that reads a string from the console that contains:
#     â€¢ Explosions marked with '>'
#     â€¢ Immediately after the mark, there will be an integer x, which signifies the strength of the explosion
#     â€¢ Any other characters
# Your task is to delete x characters, starting after the exploded character ('>').
# If you find another explosion mark ('>') while deleting characters,
# you should add the strength to your previous explosion.
# You should not delete the explosion character â€“ '>'.
