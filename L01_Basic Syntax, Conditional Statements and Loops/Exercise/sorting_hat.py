#####   Task Description   ##### 9. Sorting Hat
# Help out the sorting hat to sort the new students in the houses of Hogwarts.
# You will be receiving names until the command "Welcome!".
# The length of each name determines in which house the student is going:
# • If the name is less than 5 chars, the student is going into Gryffindor
#     o Print "{name} goes to Gryffindor."
# • If the name is exactly 5 chars, the student is going into Slytherin
#     o Print "{name} goes to Slytherin."
# • If the name is exactly 6 chars, the student is going into Ravenclaw
#     o Print "{name} goes to Ravenclaw."
# • If the name is more than 6 chars, the student is going into Hufflepuff
#     o Print "{name} goes to Hufflepuff."
# While receiving names, if you receive "Voldemort",
# print "You must not speak of that name!" and end the program. No more sorting for today!
# If all students are sorted successfully, print "Welcome to Hogwarts."
